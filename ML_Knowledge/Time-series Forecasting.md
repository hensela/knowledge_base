Time-series $(y_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N})$.


## [Time-series components](https://otexts.com/fpp2/components.html) and [patterns](https://otexts.com/fpp2/tspatterns.html)

**Additive decomposition:**  $洧녽_洧노 = 洧녡_洧노 + 洧녢_洧노 + 洧녠_洧노$
 
Appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations, or the variation around the trend-cycle, does not vary with the level of the time series.

**Multiplicative decomposition:**  $洧녽_洧노 = 洧녡_洧노 * 洧녢_洧노 * 洧녠_洧노$
 
Appropriate when the variation in the seasonal pattern, or the variation around the trend-cycle, appears to be proportional to the level of the time series. 
Can be log transformed to get an additive decomposition:

$$洧녽_洧노 = 洧녡_洧노 * 洧녢_洧노 * 洧녠_洧노 \Leftrightarrow 洧녳洧녶洧녮(洧녽_洧노) = log(洧녡_洧노) + log(洧녢_洧노) + log(洧녠_洧노)$$
 
- $洧녡_洧노$: seasonal component
- $洧녢_洧노$: trend-cycle component
- $洧녠_洧노$: remainder component
